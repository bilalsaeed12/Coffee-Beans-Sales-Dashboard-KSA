M-Code to resolve the date format issue as inital dates in dataset were in mm/dd/yyyy format and power bi was considering dd as month so we have to replace dd with mm.

let
    parts = Text.Split([Date], "/"),  // Split the string by "/"
    firstPart = parts{0},  // Extract the first part
    secondPart = parts{1}, // Extract the second part
    lastPart = parts{2},   // Extract the third part
    result = secondPart & "/" & firstPart & "/" & lastPart  // Replace first part with second part
in
    result



Dax Code for categorising customers based on number of orders. 
Customer_Category = 
VAR OrderCount = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(CoffeeSalesFact[Customer_ID]), 
        ALLEXCEPT(CoffeeSalesFact, CoffeeSalesFact[Customer_ID])
    )

RETURN
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        OrderCount <= 4, "Casual Customer",
        OrderCount <= 9, "Regular Customer",
        "Loyal Customer"
    )

Number Of Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(CoffeeSalesFact[Customer_ID])


Total Discount Given = SUM(CoffeeSalesFact[Discount_Amount])

Total Orders = COUNT(CoffeeSalesFact[Customer_ID])

Total Revenue = SUM(CoffeeSalesFact[Final Sales])

Total Units Sold = SUM(CoffeeSalesFact[Quantity])
